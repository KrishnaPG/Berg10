# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The primary interface for the MVP will be the `berg10` CLI and the Search/MCP APIs. Direct user interaction with the system's core logic will happen through these programmatic interfaces. A future Admin UI is envisioned for easier management and monitoring, but is out of scope for the MVP. The UX for the MVP focuses on the clarity and ease of use of the configuration files (for defining groups) and the intuitiveness of the CLI commands and API responses. The system should feel powerful yet straightforward for technically proficient users (Data Engineers, ML Teams) to integrate into their workflows.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- Configuration-Driven Management: Defining and managing semantic groups primarily through declarative configuration files (`config.json`).
- CLI Operations: Using the `berg10` CLI for applying configurations, listing groups, and potentially monitoring status.
- API Consumption: Interacting with the system programmatically via GraphQL, RESTful or gRPC APIs for search and MCP access.
- Event-Driven Awareness (Future): Reacting to system events (e.g., indexing completion) via broadcast mechanisms.

## Core Screens and Views

- **CLI Terminal:** The main interface for `berg10` commands (apply, list, etc.).
- **Configuration File Editor:** Editing `config.json` to define semantic groups.
- **API Response Viewer:** Viewing results from Search API or MCP endpoints (likely via scripts/tools initially).
- **(Future) Admin Dashboard:** Visualizing groups, entities, indexing status, and logs.

## Accessibility

- None (CLI and API focused for MVP)

## Branding

- N/A for core engine. Future UI to follow organizational guidelines.

## Target Device and Platforms

- Cross-Platform (CLI and backend services)
- Able to run without Docker when running as local.

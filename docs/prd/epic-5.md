# Epic 5: Automation & Observability

## Goal

Automate key system processes like re-indexing on source changes and enhance system observability through logging and metrics. This epic ensures the system is dynamic, responsive, and maintainable.

## Story 5.1: Implement File System Change Detection

As a System,
I want to detect changes in the underlying file system,
so that Semantic Groups can be automatically updated and re-indexed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  Implement a mechanism (e.g., polling, webhook listener, or LakeFS hook adapter) to detect changes (new commits, tags) in the connected file system repository.
2.  The system SHALL trigger a re-evaluation of Semantic Groups whose `versionPolicy` might be affected by the change.

## Story 5.2: Implement Automated Re-indexing Trigger

As a System,
I want to automatically re-index Semantic Entities when their source files change,
so that the semantic knowledge remains up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  When a file system change is detected, the system SHALL re-evaluate the filters for relevant Semantic Groups.
2.  For entities whose source files have changed (new version), the system SHALL trigger the indexing workflow (Epic 3) for those entities within the group.

## Story 5.3: Finalize Append-Only Audit Logging

As an Administrator,
I want a complete log of system actions,
so that I can audit changes and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  Ensure that all significant actions (group creation/deletion/update, indexing runs start/end, policy changes) are logged.
2.  Implement the append-only log storage mechanism (e.g., a file in the `semantic-repo` or a separate log store).
3.  Define the structure of log entries for consistency.

## Story 5.4: Implement Core Metrics Tracking

As an Operator,
I want to monitor the system's performance,
so that I can ensure it meets requirements and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1.  Instrument the system to track key metrics like indexing throughput (entities/sec) and API request latency.
2.  Expose these metrics in a standard format (e.g., OTL, Prometheus endpoint) or log them periodically.

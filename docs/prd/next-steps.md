# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Create the UI/UX vision and design for the future Admin Dashboard, focusing on visualizing semantic groups, entities, indexing status, and logs. Consider the user journeys for Data Engineers managing groups and Analysts exploring indexed knowledge. Use the technical considerations and target platforms from the PRD.

### Architect Prompt

Design the detailed system architecture for the Semantic Content Management System based on the PRD. Focus on the modular monolith structure for the core engine, the Git connector implementation, the integration with the chosen vector database and AI model, the `semantic-repo` storage layout, and the API/MCP server setup. Address the technical assumptions regarding repository structure, service architecture, and testing requirements. Plan for scalability and maintainability.

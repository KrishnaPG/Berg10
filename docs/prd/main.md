# Semantic Content Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable users to define and manage 'semantic groups' to organize content based on meaning rather than file paths.
- Provide a virtual layer over versioned repositories (LakeFS, Git) to abstract physical storage details.
- Allow content discovery and access through semantic queries and filters.
- Facilitate AI-driven indexing of content within semantic groups to create searchable knowledge.
- Support configurable version policies for source files and retention policies for derived indices.
- Deliver a functional MVP with core features like group definition, basic filtering, entity mapping, simple AI indexing, and a search API.
- Establish a scalable and maintainable architecture for future enhancements like complex filters, sub-groups, multiple AI models, and UI.

### Background Context

Managing and extracting value from large volumes of data stored in versioned file systems is increasingly challenging. Traditional hierarchical organization based on paths hinders discoverability and contextual access. This project addresses this by creating a semantic content management system. It introduces a virtual layer where users define 'semantic groups' using filters, grouping rules, and AI indexing criteria. This allows for flexible, potentially overlapping organizational views of data, enabling powerful AI-driven search and secure knowledge sharing across teams. The system will automatically update views and re-index content on source changes, store configurations and indices in a structured `semantic-repo`, and provide APIs for consumption by AI agents and applications. The goal is to provide a unified, flexible, and AI-powered way to manage and derive value from versioned content, starting with a focused MVP.

## Requirements

### Functional

1.  **FR1:** The system SHALL allow users to define Semantic Groups via a configuration file or API, specifying a unique name and a filter.
2.  **FR2:** The system SHALL support defining filters using simple regex patterns on filenames.
3.  **FR3:** The system SHALL support defining version policies (e.g., latest, specific tag/commit/branch) for the underlying source repository data considered by a group.
4.  **FR4:** The system SHALL allow users to define basic grouping rules to map source files into Semantic Entities (e.g., one file to one entity, one folder to one entity).
5.  **FR5:** The system SHALL support defining AI indexing criteria for Semantic Groups, including specifying an AI model and configuration parameters.
6.  **FR6:** The system SHALL automatically discover and map source files/objects to Semantic Entities within a group based on its defined filter and grouping rules.
7.  **FR7:** The system SHALL automatically trigger re-indexing of Semantic Entities when underlying source files/objects are updated, respecting the group's version policy.
8.  **FR8:** The system SHALL store generated vector embeddings and index metadata immutably in a structured `semantic-repo` layout, associating them with the source entity and indexing configuration.
9.  **FR9:** The system SHALL provide a `berg10` CLI tool for managing Semantic Groups (apply, list, delete).
10. **FR10:** The system SHALL provide a Search API to query Semantic Groups and retrieve relevant Semantic Entities based on semantic similarity of provided input.
11. **FR11:** The system SHALL maintain an append-only log of all actions related to Semantic Groups, policies, and indexing runs.
12. **FR12:** The system SHALL store all Semantic Group configurations and `semantic-repo` metadata in a versioned manner (e.g., using Git).
13. **FR13:** The system SHALL support defining retention policies for AI index versions (e.g., keep last N, expire after X time).
14. **FR14:** The system SHALL provide a basic MCP server endpoint for external AI agents to access semantic content and derived knowledge.

### Non Functional

1.  **NFR1:** The system SHALL be designed for cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, macOS) for core services and CLI.
2.  **NFR2:** The system SHALL support read-only access to underlying versioned repositories.
3.  **NFR3:** The system SHALL be designed to efficiently handle large manifest files (several GB) for index metadata.
4.  **NFR4:** The system SHALL support scalable AI indexing jobs, potentially processing large volumes of entities.
5.  **NFR5:** The Search API SHALL have a target p95 latency of < 500ms for standard queries.
6.  **NFR6:** The system SHALL implement atomic operations for updating `semantic-repo` metadata (e.g., manifest files) to prevent corruption.
7.  **NFR7:** The system SHALL be designed modularly, separating concerns like connectors, indexing, storage, and API layers.
8.  **NFR8:** The system SHALL integrate with proven, existing vector databases (e.g., Qdrant, Milvus) for search capabilities.
9.  **NFR9:** The system SHALL integrate with proven, existing AI/ML models for content indexing.
10. **NFR10:** The system SHALL provide clear and structured logging for all major operations.
11. **NFR11:** The system SHALL store `semantic-repo` index blobs using content-addressed storage (e.g., SHA256) for immutability and deduplication.
12. **NFR12:** The system SHALL be deployable using containerization (Docker) and orchestrated (Kubernetes).

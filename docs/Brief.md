# Project Brief: Semantic Content Management System

## Executive Summary

This project aims to develop a semantic content management system that acts as a virtual layer over versioned repositories (e.g., LakeFS, Git). It abstracts physical file paths, allowing users to access and manage content based on its semantic meaning (e.g., "videos from the 2023 conference") rather than its storage location. Users define "semantic groups" with filters, grouping rules, and AI indexing criteria to organize content into virtual, potentially overlapping hierarchies. This enables powerful AI-driven search, knowledge derivation, and secure, context-aware sharing of insights derived from the underlying data across an organization.

## Problem Statement

Traditional file systems organize data hierarchically based on physical paths, making it difficult to find and utilize content based on its meaning or context. As data volumes grow, especially in versioned systems, managing and extracting value becomes complex. Users struggle with:
-   **Discoverability:** Finding relevant content across dispersed or versioned locations.
-   **Contextual Access:** Accessing content based on its semantic meaning (e.g., all financial reports mentioning a specific topic) rather than file paths.
-   **AI Knowledge Silos:** Deriving AI insights (e.g., embeddings) from data in isolated, non-shareable ways.
-   **Collaborative Overlays:** Different teams needing different organizational views of the same underlying data without duplicating storage.
-   **Version Management:** Handling how different versions of files contribute to semantic views and derived AI knowledge.

Existing solutions often require manual organization or rigid folder structures, failing to provide a flexible, semantic, and AI-enhanced way to manage and leverage versioned content.

## Proposed Solution

We propose building a system that introduces a virtual semantic layer. Users define `semantic groups` using:
1.  **Filters:** To select files based on attributes (name, size, date) or complex conditions, including version policies (e.g., only latest, specific tag).
2.  **Grouping Rules:** To map selected files or parts of files (e.g., PDF pages) into `semantic entities`, the basic unit of access.
3.  **AI Indexing:** To apply models (e.g., NLP, computer vision) to these entities, creating searchable embeddings with configurable versioning and access controls.

This system will:
-   Automatically update semantic views and re-index content when underlying files change (respecting version policies).
-   Allow overlapping, recursive sub-groups for flexible organization.
-   Store all configurations, indices, and an immutable audit log in a structured, versioned `semantic-repo`.
-   Expose powerful APIs (search, MCP) for AI agents and applications to consume the semantic content and derived knowledge.
-   Enable real-time event broadcasting for system changes.

This approach provides a unified, flexible, and AI-powered way to manage and derive value from versioned content.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Data Engineers & AI/ML Teams
These users are responsible for building and maintaining data pipelines and AI models within an organization. They need efficient ways to access, organize, and process large volumes of versioned data.
-   **Needs & Goals:** Access relevant data subsets easily for training/processing, ensure data lineage/versioning is respected, integrate semantic views into pipelines, derive and share AI knowledge efficiently.
### Secondary User Segment: Knowledge Workers & Analysts
These users consume data and insights derived from it. They require powerful search and access to organized knowledge.
-   **Needs & Goals:** Find information quickly using semantic queries, access contextually relevant data/knowledge, collaborate using shared semantic views.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
-   **Adoption:** Achieve 80% of target internal teams actively using semantic groups for data access or knowledge derivation within 6 months of launch.
-   **Efficiency:** Reduce time spent by data engineers on manual data discovery/organization tasks by 50%.
-   **Knowledge Reuse:** Increase cross-team utilization of AI-derived knowledge by 70% (measured by API/MCP access patterns).

### User Success Metrics
-   **Search Success Rate:** >90% of semantic search queries return relevant results within top 5 hits.
-   **Time to Value:** New user can define a basic semantic group and perform a search within 30 minutes.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
-   **Number of Active Semantic Groups:** Track growth of defined groups.
-   **Index Throughput:** Number of entities indexed per hour.
-   **API Request Latency:** Average response time for search/MCP queries.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **Semantic Group Definition:** Basic CRUD operations for groups with simple regex filename filtering.
- **File System Integration:** Read-only connector for at least one backend (e.g., LakeFS).
- **Semantic Entity Mapping:** Basic grouping logic (e.g., folder-to-entity, single-file-to-single-entity).
- **Storage Layer Implementation:** Implement the core `semantic-repo` layout (`.semantic/`, `groups/`, basic blob/manifest structure).
- **Simple AI Indexing:** Integrate a single, configurable embedding model to index entities and store results.
- **Basic Search API:** API endpoint to perform simple semantic search within a group/lane.
- **Audit Logging:** Record group/indexing actions in an append-only log.
- **`semanticctl` CLI:** Basic CLI tool for group management (`apply`, `list`).

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Complex AND/OR/NOT filters.
- Multi-modal content handling.
- Advanced sub-grouping logic (e.g., page ranges).
- Multiple AI model indexing.
- Fine-grained ABAC for indices.
- Real-time event broadcasting.
- Conflict resolution UI.
- GraphQL API.
- `dry-run` CLI feature.

### MVP Success Criteria
The MVP is successful if users can define a semantic group, see relevant files/entities appear, have them indexed by a simple AI model, and retrieve them via the search API. The core `semantic-repo` structure is proven functional.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
- Implement complex filtering/grouping.
- Add support for sub-groups.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** Development resources for a small team initially.
- **Timeline:** Functional MVP within 3-4 months.
- **Resources:** Limited dedicated DevOps support initially.
- **Technical:** Must rely on existing, proven AI models and vector databases.

### Key Assumptions
- Users understand the concept of versioned file systems.
- Initial user base is technically proficient (e.g., data engineers).
- Cloud or on-prem infrastructure is available for deployment.
- Standard AI embedding models are sufficient for initial use cases.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Performance Bottleneck:** Large manifest files or indexing jobs could become a performance bottleneck. Mitigation: Plan sharding, bulk inserts, and cold-start optimizations from the beginning.
- **Complexity Creep:** Semantic group definitions and AI configurations could become overly complex. Mitigation: Start simple, iterate based on user feedback.
- **Adoption Hurdle:** Users might find the paradigm shift challenging. Mitigation: Strong documentation, clear CLI/API examples, and a compelling MVP.

### Open Questions
- What is the exact data model for complex filter/grouping rules?
- How will access control for indices be technically implemented (ABAC framework)?
- What specific vector database will be integrated first?

### Areas Needing Further Research

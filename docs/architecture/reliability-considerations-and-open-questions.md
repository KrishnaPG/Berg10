# Reliability Considerations and Open Questions

The following reliability weak-links have been identified and require further architectural decisions:

## 1. Vector Database Reliability
**Open Question:** What reliability mechanisms should be implemented for the vector database (Milvus/Qdrant)?
**Considerations:**
- Backup/restore strategy for vector indices
- Failover mechanism for vector DB
- Data replication across vector DB instances
- Health monitoring for vector DB availability

## 2. Semantic Repository Data Protection
**Decision:** The backup strategy for the `semantic-repo` will differ based on the operational mode.

-   **Local Mode:** Backup is the user's responsibility. Users are encouraged to push their project, including the `.semantic` directory, to a remote Git repository as part of their standard workflow. The system will ensure atomic file writes to prevent local corruption during operations.
-   **Enterprise Mode:** An automated, regular backup is mandatory. The recommended strategy is a scheduled job (e.g., a Kubernetes CronJob) that executes a `git push` from the live `semantic-repo` to a remote, secure, and backed-up bare Git repository (e.g., on GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, or a dedicated server).

## 3. AI/ML Service Reliability
**Open Question:** What reliability mechanisms should be implemented for external AI/ML services (Hugging Face/Cloud AI)?
**Considerations:**
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker for AI service failures
- Fallback to local models when cloud services fail
- Caching of embeddings for offline scenarios

**Decision:** To ensure resilience when interacting with external AI/ML services, the following will be implemented:

-   **Retry with Exponential Backoff:** All API calls to external services will be wrapped in a retry mechanism (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff) to handle transient network issues or temporary service unavailability.
-   **Circuit Breaker:** A circuit breaker pattern will be implemented to prevent the system from repeatedly calling a failing service. If a service fails consistently, the breaker will trip, and indexing jobs requiring that service will fail fast for a configured cool-down period.
-   **Caching (Future):** While not in the MVP, the design will allow for a future caching layer for embeddings to reduce redundant API calls.

## 4. Event Processing Reliability
**Open Question:** What event-driven architecture should be implemented for change detection?
**Considerations:**
- Event store for change events
- Replay mechanism for missed events
- Dead letter queue for failed processing
- Idempotency handling for duplicate events

## 5. Data Pipeline Reliability
**Open Question:** What reliability mechanisms should be implemented for the indexing pipeline?
**Considerations:**
- Checkpointing for long-running indexing jobs
- Retry mechanism for failed indexing steps
- Rollback mechanism for failed index updates
- Validation of index integrity

## 6. Configuration Management Reliability
**Open Question:** What reliability mechanisms should be implemented for semantic group configurations?
**Considerations:**
- Configuration validation on apply
- Configuration backup/versioning
- Rollback mechanism for bad configurations
- Atomic configuration updates

## 7. Cross-Service Communication Reliability
**Open Question:** What reliability mechanisms should be implemented for inter-service communication?
**Considerations:**
- Service mesh for resilience
- Circuit breakers between components
- Timeout/retry policies for service calls
- Health checks for service dependencies

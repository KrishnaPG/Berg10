# Introduction

This document details the architecture for the Berg10 Semantic Content Management System, as defined by the Product Requirements Document (PRD). It outlines the system's structure, components, data flow, and technology choices to guide development. The architecture is based on a modular monolith for the core engine, with distinct modules for connectors, indexing, storage, and API layers, designed for future scalability towards microservices.

This architecture serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development of Berg10, ensuring consistency and alignment with the project's goals of enabling semantic content organization, AI-driven indexing, and flexible API access.
